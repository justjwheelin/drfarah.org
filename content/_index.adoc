She earned her Bachelor's degree in Dentistry from https://au.edu.sy/en/home[Al Andalus University for Medical Sciences] in Syria and has since dedicated her career to providing excellent dental care and expanding her professional expertise internationally.

Farah's calling for dentistry was born from a fundamental passion to heal and a drive to improve the standard of healthcare in her community.
During her university studies, she was proactive, participating in outreach campaigns that brought essential dental care information to local schools and surrounding villages.
Her commitment to community service also led her to volunteer with her cityâ€™s Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) as part of the https://the.akdn/en/home[Aga Khan Development Network] and to work with the _Al Shams_ volunteer team on local youth initiatives.

Upon graduating, Farah began her professional career with a post-graduate internship at a clinic in Qadmus-Tartous, Syria.
Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit, she then established her own private dental practice in the same area in January 2022.
As the owner and primary practitioner, she was responsible for all aspects of the business and for providing essential dental care to her community for nearly two years.
During this time, Farah also expanded her skills into aesthetics, working for a year at a local beauty center where she provided specialized skincare treatments.

In pursuit of new professional horizons, Farah Aldali made the life-changing decision to move to Germany.
Her goal is to become a fully licensed dental practitioner in Germany.
To achieve this, she has dedicated herself to mastering the German language and understanding the intricacies of the German healthcare system.
She gained valuable hands-on experience working as a dentist assistant at a dental clinic in northern Germany.

Today, alongside her studies, Farah is an active content creator on social media.
Through her Instagram account, https://www.instagram.com/drfarahaldali/[@drfarahaldali], she shares a wide range of content, from medical information about dentistry and skincare to her personal experiences with travel, food, and life in Germany.
